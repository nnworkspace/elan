## Report provenance and generation method

This report is a **derived artefact**, generated automatically from upstream project data.

**Primary inputs:**
- Git commit history covering the reporting period
- Repository artefact structure and metadata

**Automation pipeline:**
- Pipeline ID: PIPELINE-REP-WEEKLY-01
- Pipeline purpose: Weekly project progress summarisation
- Pipeline location: `80-ci-cd/reports/weekly-progress`
- Execution mode: Scheduled (illustrative)

**Derivation method:**
- Raw commit data collected via automated repository queries
- Semantic grouping and summarisation performed using an AI-assisted process

**AI system used for narrative synthesis:**
- Name: gemini
- Version: 3.0 (illustrative)
- Hosting environment: Eurosystem hosted instance (illustrative)

**Human intervention:**
- None (fully automated generation for demonstrative purposes)

**Reproducibility note:**
Given the same inputs and generation parameters, this report is intended to be reproducible.  
Minor narrative variation may occur due to the probabilistic nature of AI-based summarisation, without affecting factual content.

This provenance section exists to demonstrate how **automated reporting mechanisms** should be made transparent, auditable, and attributable in institutional contexts. And how it can be generated automatically from structured work.
