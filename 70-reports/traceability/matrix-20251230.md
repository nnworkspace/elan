# Digital Euro Traceability Matrix

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DISCLAIMER**: This report is **illustrative and educational**.
> It demonstrates how project evidence might be summarised in a complex institutional system.
> It does **not** represent official reporting formats, audit deliverables, or management dashboards for the Digital Euro or any other real-world project.

**Project:** Policy-to-Production Workbench
**Date:** 2025-12-30

## Report provenance and generation method

This report is a **derived artefact**, generated automatically from upstream project data.

**Primary inputs:**
- Source code annotations (`@SpecLink`, `#[spec_link]`, `gov.SpecLink`) in `60-code`
- Specification definitions in `40-specifications`

**Automation pipeline:**
- Pipeline ID: PIPELINE-REP-TRACE-01
- Pipeline purpose: Regulatory Compliance & Audit Trail
- Pipeline location: `80-automation/reports/traceability`
- Execution mode: On-Demand (Release Candidates)

**Derivation method:**
- Static Analysis (AST parsing) of all source files.
- Cross-referencing against `40-specifications` requirement IDs.

**AI system used:**
- None (Deterministic deterministic generation).

**Human intervention:**
- None.

**Reproducibility note:**
Given the same commit hash, this matrix is bit-for-bit reproducible.

This provenance section exists to demonstrate how **automated reporting mechanisms** should be made transparent, auditable, and attributable in institutional contexts. And how it can be generated automatically from structured work.

## Executive Summary

This matrix demonstrates the **compliance coverage** of the current codebase.
- **Total Requirements Mapped:** 9
- **Unlinked Code Blocks:** 0 (in audited paths)
- **Coverage Status:** **PARTIAL** (Educational Subset)

## Audit Findings

> [!NOTE]
> This matrix is illustrative. In a real production system, this table would contain thousands of rows, automatically paginated and filterable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Gap Analysis**: `governance-common` libraries are currently treated as infrastructure and exempt from direct requirement mapping in this view, though they enforce the mechanics.
