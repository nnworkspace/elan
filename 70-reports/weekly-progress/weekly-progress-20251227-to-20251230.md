# Weekly Project Progress Summary

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DISCLAIMER**: This report is **illustrative and educational**.
> It demonstrates how executive reporting can be generated automatically from structured project activity.  
> It does **not** represent official reporting for the Digital Euro or any real-world programme.

**Reporting period:** 27–30 December 2025  
**Project:** Policy-to-Production Workbench (Educational Demonstrator)

## Report provenance, generation method and limitations

This report is a **derived artefact**, generated automatically from upstream project data.

**Primary inputs:**
- Git commit history covering the reporting period
- Artefact classification and folder/repository structure

**Automation pipeline:**
- Pipeline ID: PIPELINE-REP-WEEKLY-01
- Pipeline purpose: Weekly project progress synthesis
- Pipeline location: `80-automation/reports/weekly-progress` (illustrative)
- Execution mode: Scheduled (illustrative)

**Derivation method:**
- Raw commit data collected via automated repository queries
- Semantic grouping and synthesis using an AI-assisted process

**AI system used:**
- Name: ChatGPT
- Version: GPT-5.x (illustrative)
- Hosting environment: Eurosystem hosted instance (illustrative)

**Human intervention:**
- None (fully automated generation for demonstrative purposes)

**Reproducibility note:**
Given the same inputs and generation parameters, this report is intended to be reproducible.  
Minor narrative variation may occur due to the probabilistic nature of AI-based synthesis, without affecting factual content.

This section exists to demonstrate how **report provenance, tooling, and accountability** should be explicit in institutional automation.

## Executive summary

Over the past three days, the project transitioned decisively from conceptual governance into **executable governance and automation**.

The repository now demonstrates a complete institutional lifecycle:  
from policy and specifications, through assurance and implementation scaffolding, to automated reporting and governance enforcement.

This marks the completion of the **first coherent iteration** of the Elan workbench.

---

## Key developments

### Governance becomes executable
- Governance rules were formalised and enforced mechanically:
  - commit message enforcement,
  - branching strategy,
  - artefact classification and versioning.
- Governance is no longer descriptive; it is **machine-enforced**.

### Specifications and assurance stabilised
- Fictional but realistic specifications were finalised and versioned.
- A full assurance structure was established:
  - functional conformance,
  - contract definitions,
  - security controls,
  - operational and performance claims,
  - canonical test vectors.

### Implementation layer scaffolded
- Core system components were scaffolded across multiple technology stacks.
- A shared “governance common” library was introduced to embed traceability directly into code.

### Automation and reporting introduced
- Institutional-grade automation patterns were added.
- Automated report templates were created.
- This weekly summary is itself the **first artefact** of the reporting system.

## What was intentionally out of scope

- No production business logic
- No live deployments
- No executed performance or security tests

The focus was on **structure, traceability, and durability**, not optimisation.

---

## Overall assessment

The project now possesses:

- a unified policy-to-production model,
- mechanically enforceable governance,
- traceable specifications, tests, and code,
- and an automated reporting layer.

Progress can now be measured **continuously and objectively**, rather than narrated.

---

## Outlook

The next phase will focus on:

- initial introduction of the Elan workbench to the audience,
- reducing the inconsistency between governance rules and their enforcement within this workbench,
- developing more complete and realistic governance rules and their enforcement mechanisms,
- selectively implementing features to demonstrate end-to-end traceability,
- and generating additional derived reports.

No new governance decisions are required to proceed.
