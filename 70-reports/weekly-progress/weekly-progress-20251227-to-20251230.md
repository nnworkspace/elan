# Weekly Project Progress Summary

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DISCLAIMER**: This report is **illustrative and educational**.
> It demonstrates how project evidence might be summarised in a complex institutional system.
> It does **not** represent official reporting formats, audit deliverables, or management dashboards for the Digital Euro or any other real-world project.

**Reporting period:** 27–30 December 2025  
**Project:** Policy-to-Production Workbench (Educational Demonstrator)

## Report provenance, generation method and limitations

This report is a **derived artefact**, generated automatically from upstream project data.

**Primary inputs:**
- Git commit history covering the reporting period
- Repository artefact structure and metadata

**Automation pipeline:**
- Pipeline ID: PIPELINE-REP-WEEKLY-01
- Pipeline purpose: Weekly project progress summarisation
- Pipeline location: `80-ci-cd/reports/weekly-progress`
- Execution mode: Scheduled (illustrative)

**Derivation method:**
- Raw commit data collected via automated repository queries
- Semantic grouping and summarisation performed using an AI-assisted process

**AI system used for narrative synthesis:**
- Name: ChatGPT
- Version: GPT-5.x (illustrative)
- Hosting environment: Eurosystem hosted instance (illustrative)

**Human intervention:**
- None (fully automated generation for demonstrative purposes)

**Reproducibility note:**
Given the same inputs and generation parameters, this report is intended to be reproducible.  
Minor narrative variation may occur due to the probabilistic nature of AI-based summarisation, without affecting factual content.

This provenance section exists to demonstrate how **automated reporting mechanisms** should be made transparent, auditable, and attributable in institutional contexts. And how it can be generated automatically from structured work.

## Executive summary

Over the past three days, the project has made **substantial structural progress**, moving decisively from conceptual governance into **mechanically enforceable foundations**.

The focus of this period was not feature delivery, but the establishment of a **durable, institution-grade workbench** capable of supporting complex, multi-stakeholder systems end to end.

By the end of the period, the repository now demonstrates a complete lifecycle from governance and specifications through testing, implementation scaffolding, reporting, and automation.

---

## Key accomplishments

### 1. Governance framework completed and enforced

- The governance layer was significantly expanded and stabilised.
- Formal artefact classification, visibility rules, versioning, and traceability concepts were finalised.
- Mechanical governance was introduced, including:
  - commit message enforcement,
  - branching strategy documentation,
  - and explicit governance manifests.

This establishes a **constitutional baseline** for all subsequent work.

---

### 2. Specifications and assurance structure matured

- Fictional but realistic technical specifications were completed for:
  - participant onboarding,
  - liquidity reservation.
- Specifications were refactored to be **version-aware and machine-consumable**.
- A layered assurance model was fully defined and populated:
  - functional conformance scenarios,
  - interface contracts,
  - security controls,
  - operational and performance assurances,
  - canonical test vectors.

This provides a clear demonstration of how intent is translated into verifiable claims.

---

### 3. Reporting layer introduced

- The reporting concept was formalised as a first-class artefact layer.
- Reports were explicitly defined as **derived evidence**, not sources of truth.
- The groundwork was laid for automated, executive-readable summaries driven by repository activity rather than manual status updates.

This weekly summary is the **first concrete example** of that approach.

---

### 4. Implementation layer scaffolded across multiple components

- The implementation layer was brought to life with realistic component boundaries:
  - Access Gateway,
  - Alias Service,
  - Digital Euro Service Platform (DESP),
  - PSP-side component.
- Each component was scaffolded using an appropriate technology stack, illustrating polyglot reality.
- A shared governance instrumentation library was introduced across multiple stacks.

This demonstrates how heterogeneous implementations can still participate in a single governed system.

---

### 5. Governance instrumentation introduced at code level

- A cross-cutting “governance common” component was introduced (Java, Node.js, Rust).
- Code-level traceability primitives were added, enabling:
  - explicit links between implementation and specifications,
  - version-aware accountability,
  - future automated coverage and audit reporting.

This marks the transition from **documented governance** to **executable governance**.

---

## What this period did *not* focus on (intentionally)

- No production-ready business logic was implemented.
- No real CI/CD pipelines were deployed.
- No performance or security tests were executed against running systems.

These omissions are deliberate and documented. The emphasis was on **structure before optimisation**.

---

## Overall assessment

At the end of this reporting period, the project has successfully established:

- a unified policy-to-production mental model,
- a complete, traceable artefact chain,
- and a credible foundation for automation, reporting, and audit.

The workbench is now structurally complete enough that **future progress can be measured mechanically**, rather than narrated manually.

---

## Next focus (high level)

The next phase is expected to concentrate on:

- CI/CD illustrative implementation,
- wiring traceability metadata into CI/CD workflows,
- generating additional automated reports (coverage, assurance, drift),
- and selectively deepening one or two components for demonstration purposes.

No new governance decisions are required to proceed.
