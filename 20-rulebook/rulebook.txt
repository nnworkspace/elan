                      DISCLAIMERS FOR DRAFT RULEBOOK v0.9

Preliminary and non-binding nature of version 0.9

This document represents a preliminary draft version (version 0.9) of the digital euro scheme rulebook and
reflects the ECB's continuous effort to develop a draft rulebook in close cooperation with the Rulebook
Development Group (RDG) 1, comprising senior representatives from European associations representing
both the supply and demand side of the retail payments market. Version 0.9, which was shared with the
RDG members on 30 June 2025, is non-binding and does not necessarily reflect the final views of the ECB,
the Eurosystem, the RDG, or any of its members or their constituencies.

Rulebook development process

The content of version 0.9 is subject to further adjustments and refinements as part of the development
process in the context of the digital euro project’s preparation phase, as well as necessary adjustments
arising from legislative discussions.

This document has not been approved by the ECB's decision-making bodies. It is a working document
meant to involve stakeholders and foster transparency and collaboration in the rulebook development
process. As a result, version 0.9 incorporates input from various stakeholders, including members of the
RDG, who in turn represent diverse perspectives from both the public and private sectors. While care has
been taken to represent accurately all views and forge consensus where possible, the combined content
of version 0.9 need not fully reflect the views of individual RDG members, their organisations, or the broader
constituencies they represent.

A final draft of the preliminary rulebook will incorporate any future amendments stemming from legislative
discussions among co-legislators on the European Commission's proposed regulation on the establishment
of the digital euro 2 and be subject to public consultation.

Informational purpose only

The publication of this draft is for informational purposes only and does not constitute or imply any
commitment, guarantee or precise assurance regarding the final content, standards and scope of the digital
euro rulebook. The publication of this draft is not meant to create expectations of the ECB endorsement or
finality of any specific policy, framework, legal or operational approach related to the digital euro. The
document should be considered as a reflection of a work-in-progress, open to ongoing input and discussion.

No reliance for implementation

Due to its preliminary nature, the draft rulebook version 0.9 is not intended for use as a basis for
implementing any systems, processes, or policies related to the digital euro. Any such actions, prior to the
publication of the officially approved rulebook, are under actors’ own responsibility.

                                                PREAMBLE

The draft digital euro scheme rulebook is being developed by the Eurosystem together with the support
from the digital euro scheme rulebook development group (RDG). The current draft rulebook has been
further developed compared to the last version 0.8 of the draft rulebook, which was commented by the RDG
and its constituencies. The current draft has been advanced in both structure and content based on the
RDG comments received, further elaborations and discussions, and benefited from the various RDG
workstreams.

The current version is generally based on the 2023 proposal for a regulation on the establishment of the
digital euro (2023/0212/COD) and the Regulation on the provision of digital euro services by payment
services providers incorporated in Member States whose currency is not the euro (2023/0211/COD). Both
proposals are currently subject to the legislative process, in which the EU co-legislators can decide to
amend the proposals. Therefore, the current draft rulebook remains sufficiently flexible to cater for potential
adjustments and can only be finalised after the adoption of both regulations. Furthermore, other areas of
the rulebook will be further developed in line with ongoing elaborations on complex subject matters and
decisions by the Governing Council of the ECB or are dependent on the selection of service providers.

As a result, all along this draft rulebook, text highlighted in yellow refers to placeholders to be updated at
later stage when associated decisions or developments are made.

The purpose of the current draft is to inform the RDG and its constituencies, and to invite them for further
comments in order to further advance the rulebook drafting.

This document represents a preliminary draft version which has not yet been subject to a general language
and editorial review.

0.3     Change history

The change history has the following logic. Until the delivery of draft rulebook version 0.8, incremental
changes were made with each RDG meeting. Since version 0.8, reviews in form of new version numbers
are made in line with commenting rounds.

New versions 0.9x will be made in line with commenting rounds. Version 1.0 will describe the first draft
version as approved by the Governing Council of the ECB and only after the issuance of the draft regulation
[1]. The public consultation will be on this first version of the first draft after its alignment with the EU
Regulation.

After finalisation of version 1.0 the versions included in the change history will be reset and subsequently
follow updates according to the rulebook change management process (see section 10).

1      Scheme rulebook scope

1.1      Section overview

This section articulates the objectives of the digital euro scheme rulebook and delineates its scope. The
section specifies the scope of the rulebook in terms of: geographical coverage, actors and their relationships,
offered services and solutions. It also clarifies its interaction with other digital euro documentation.

1.2      Objectives

In accordance with article 5(2) of chapter II of draft regulation [1], the digital euro scheme rulebook provides
a single set of measures, rules and standards for the provision of digital euro payments services.

The digital euro rulebook ensures a standardised digital euro payment experience across all Member States
of the euro area, irrespective of the country or the PSP used. It leverages, to the extent possible, on existing
industry standards and procedures to improve interoperability and promote harmonisation within the
European payments infrastructure.

1.3      Geographical scope

In accordance with article 13(1) of chapter IV of draft regulation [1], the digital euro scheme rulebook covers
the provision of digital euro payment services by PSPs to natural and legal persons residing or established

1.4       Participants' scope

1.4.1      Actors involved

The provision and usage of digital euro payment services involve the following actors, acknowledging that
an actor may serve as another actor depending on the context (e.g., a payer may also act as a payee):

      •    Payer, which can be ‘’anyone who has a digital euro payment account and allows a payment order
           from that digital euro payment account’’ 3. A payer can either be a natural or a legal person. The
           rulebook and its annexes occasionally refers to the Payer as the "consumer" or "digital euro
           individual user," depending on context.
      •    Payee, which can be ‘’anyone who is the intended recipient of funds which have been the subject
           of a digital euro payment transaction’’ 4. A payee can either be a natural or a legal person. The
           rulebook and its annexes occasionally refers to the Payee as the ‘’merchant’’ or ‘’digital euro
           business user’’, depending on context.
      •    Payment service providers (PSPs) participating to the digital euro scheme. These can be either:
                 o     Payer PSP: the PSP providing digital euro payments services to the payer 5. The rulebook
                       and its annexes occasionally refers to the Payer PSP as the ‘’payer distributing PSP’’ or
                       ‘’digital euro individual user PSP’’, depending on context; or;
                 o     Payee PSP: the PSP providing digital euro payments services to the payee. In case the
                       payee is a digital euro business user, this actor is referred to as the acquiring PSP. The
                       rulebook and its annexes also occasionally refers to the Payee PSP as the ‘’payee
                       distributing PSP’’ or the ‘’business user PSP’’, depending on context; or;
                 o     Payer’s commercial bank money PSP: the PSP which holds the payer’s linked non-
                       digital euro payment account which can be used for funding and defunding of a digital euro
                       payment account. The payer’s commercial bank money PSP is required for reverse
                       waterfall transactions. The payer’s commercial bank money PSP can be or cannot be the
                       same entity as the payer PSP, or;
                 o     Payee’s commercial bank money PSP is the PSP which holds the payee’s linked non-
                       digital euro payment account which can be used for funding and defunding of a digital euro
                       payment account. The payee’s commercial bank money PSP is required for waterfall
                       transactions. The payee’s commercial bank money PSP can be or can not be the same
                       entity as the payee PSP / the acquiring PSP.

    •   (Potential) third-party services providers are the parties contracted by one or several of the
        PSPs defined above to support their provision of digital euro payments services. Third-party service
        providers are not bound to a specific service and may support PSPs on services related to the
        digital euro based on a contractual agreement.
    •   Digital euro scheme governing authority
    •   Provider(s) of the digital euro service platform (DESP)
    •   Providers of TARGET services relevant to the provision of the digital euro payment services.

1.4.2   Scheme participants

Article 13 of draft regulation [1] specifies the types of PSPs required to enable their clients, upon request,
to use their accounts for funding and defunding their digital euro accounts. These PSPs are, therefore,
participants in the digital euro scheme, acting at a minimum as ‘’commercial bank money PSPs’’.

Article 14 of draft regulation [1] defines the types of credit institutions required to provide digital euro
payment services at their clients' request. These institutions are digital euro scheme participants, acting at
least as ‘’distributing PSPs’’.

Other PSPs may choose to join the digital euro scheme voluntarily, provided they meet the eligibility criteria
and complete the adherence process outlined in Section 2 of the rulebook. These institutions are digital
euro scheme participants.

The payer PSPs, payee PSPs, acquiring PSPs, the payer’s commercial bank money PSP and the payee’s
commercial bank money PSP are all scheme participants. Scheme participants are also referred to as
‘participants’ in the rulebook.

1.4.3   Relationships between actors

Figure 1.1 illustrates, in a simplified manner, the actors mentioned before and involved in digital euro
payment services and their relationships, categorised into six types.




                                    Figure 1-1 Scheme actors model

(1) The relationship between a PSP participating in the scheme and the Scheme Governing
    Authority is defined in the digital euro scheme rulebook to which the particpants need to adhere to.

(2) The relationship between a participating PSP and the providers of DESP and TARGET services
    is not governed by the digital euro scheme rulebook. The DESP services provided to PSPs by the
    Eurosystem will be detailed in the respective DESP legal framework. The provision of DESP DCAs to
    PSPs will be governed by the TARGET Guideline.

(3) The relationship between the digital euro user (payer, payee) and their PSP for digital euro
    payment services are outlined in the respective PSP’s Terms and Conditions, which are not directly
    governed by the digital euro scheme rulebook. However, participating PSPs will be expected to reflect,
    in their Terms and Conditions,their obligations under the digital euro scheme rulebook to ensure
    harmonised provision of basic digital euro payment services.

(4) The relationship between a participating PSP and its third-party service provider are governed
    by their bilateral contractual arrangements and not directly by the digital euro scheme rulebook.
    Participating PSPs are responsible for incorporating relevant rulebook provisions into these contracts
    to ensure the PSP’s continued compliance with the rulebook in delivering digital euro payment services.

(5) The relationship between the payer and payee falls under national private law and is outside the
      scope of the rulebook, with its validity having no impact on the final settlement of digital euro
      transactions within the scheme.

(6) The relationship between the DESP/TARGET service provider(s) and the Scheme Governing
      authority is not in scope of the rulebook.

For the offline digital euro payment transactions, PSPs are not directly involved since holdings are
transferred directly between users' offline digital euro devices. PSPs handle funding and defunding requests.
A participation model specific to offline digital euro use cases will be included in a future version of the
rulebook.

2     Participation and adherence requirements

2.1      Section overview

This section outlines the requirements for participation in the digital euro scheme. It includes the eligibility
criteria and the process for becoming a participant. The section details the liability regime between PSPs
and the Eurosystem.

In addition, it informs on the requirement to comply with rulebook provisions at all times and the
consequences of a participant's non-adherence with the rulebook requirements, while also addressing
potential exemptions and scheme governing authority rights. Finally, it describes the procedure for a
participant's withdrawal from the scheme, ensuring participants understand their obligations and rights.

2.2      Scheme participation

Further details on the onboarding process will be provided in a dedicated scheme and DESP onboarding
guides. For the offline digital euro, the XXX may differ and next version(s) of the rulebook will provide details
on this.

As outlined in section 1.4.2, of the rulebook, certain institutions are mandated to join the scheme, while
others may do so voluntarily. All PSPs joining the scheme shall meet the eligibility criteria defined in Section
2.2.1.


2.2.1      Eligibility Criteria


PAR.01        In order to be eligible to become a scheme participant, an entity shall fullfil the following eligibility
              criteria and demonstrate them when requesting participation and during their onboarding
              process to the scheme:
           (1) the entity shall be an account servicing payment service provider under Directive [4], be
               authorised by a relevant EU regulatory body and be supervised by competent authorities
               incorporated in EU Member States. Or be incorporated and appropriately authorised by a
               relevant regulatory body and supervised by competent authorities incorporated in third
               countries which have signed an agreement with the EU under Art 19 or amended                 an
               existing monetary agreement under Art 20 of the draft regulation [1].
           (2) the entity needs to have a signed and valid servicing contract with the operator of the digital

         (3) the entity needs to have access to a DESP DCA, i.e. being able to be debited/credited in a
             DESP DCA as part of a funding/defunding operation, but not necessarily owning or being able
             to directly instruct a DESP DCA; and
         (4) the entity shall meet the rules set by the digital euro scheme rulebook.

PAR.02      An applicant/scheme participant shall meet the eligibility criteria at all times i.e. also after having
            been granted scheme participation.

PAR.03      An applicant/scheme participant shall notify the scheme governing authority of any matter that
            does or could change or materially affect its eligibility to participate without undue delay.

PAR.04      In the event the scheme participant does not fulfill eligibility criteria PAR.01(1) any longer, the
            scheme governing authority will terminate the participation in the scheme.

PAR.05      In the event a scheme participant does not fulfill eligibility criteria PAR.01(2) or PAR.01(3), the
            scheme governing authority may terminate the participation in the scheme (see PAR.61).

PAR.06      In the event a scheme participant does not fulfill the eligibility criteria PAR.01(4), the scheme
            governing authority will start the process described in the rulebook for not adhering to scheme
            rules (see section 2.5).

PAR.07      The scheme governing authority must take reasonable measures to inform the scheme
            participant of matters affecting a scheme participant’s participation status. The scheme
            governing authority may take measures to inform other scheme participants or digital euro users
            of a loss of eligibility.
2.2.2    Becoming a participant


PAR.08      To become a scheme participant an applicant shall undergo the onboarding process to the
            scheme, including the necessary processes required to meet eligility criteria PAR.01(2) and
            PAR.01(3). The applicant shall further conduct an initial self-assessment of adherence with
            rulebook requirements in line with the eligibility criteria under section 2.2.1. Applicants shall

2.2.2.5 PSP solution(s) approval

PAR.19          The [Certification Entity] of the scheme governing authority shall prepare a technical solution
                certificate summary report based on the front-end, end-to-end and DESP certificates for the
                applicant and submit it to the scheme governing authority, which is responsible for approving
                the PSP's solution(s). This approval process is based on the verification that the PSP solution(s)
                meets all certification requirements necessary for providing digital euro payment services.

PAR.20          The applicant shall at all times cooperate in the process of approval and provide additional
                documentation or undergo any additional activities (e.g. re-testing) as reasonably required by
                the scheme governing authority. Non-compliance with the solution(s) approval requirements
                can lead to the non-completion or delay of the onboarding process and possibly result in not
                being able to provide digital euro basic services as required bythe draft regulation [1].
The details for PSP solution(s) approval are described in annex A1 Testing and Certification.

This section will cover the liability regime of the scheme governing authority and PSPs.

2.4     Adherence to the rulebook

PAR.26     A scheme participant shall adhere to (or comply with) the digital euro scheme rulebook from the
           moment it joins the scheme, ensuring full adherence with all rulebook provisions throughout its
           participation. This obligation also applies in case of outsourcing and use of third-party service
           providers.

PAR.27     Furthermore, scheme participants shall ensure that the requirements eventually applicable to
           merchants and customers are complied with, by the latter.

PAR.28     A scheme participant shall conduct self-assessments of adherence with rulebook requirements
           initially, at the point of onboarding in line with section 2.2.2., and continuously afterwards, on an
           annual basis. A scheme participant shall communicate the outcome of of the self-assessments
           to the scheme governing authority. For the purpose of conducting self-assessments, an
           assessment methodology and templates will be provided by the scheme governing authority to
           scheme participants.

PAR.29     A scheme participant must promptly, upon identification, report a breach with a rulebook rule to
           the governing authority. In case a scheme participant has identified a breach with a rule of the
           rulebook, the scheme participant may request a temporary exemption because of specific
           circumstances from the governing authority in line with the exemption requirements outlined in
           section 2.6.

PAR.30     The governing authority will also assess a scheme participant's adherence to the rulebook.
           Other stakeholders may inform the governing authority of potential non-adherence of a scheme
           participant, including, through reports or feedback from digital euro users via established
           complaint mechanisms.

PAR.31     In case the governing authority has confirmed the non-adherence, the scheme participant will
           be informed and requested to refrain from the actions resulting in non-adherence and/or take
           any appropriate remedial action.

PAR.32     The response of the governing authority to non-adherence is commensurate with the severity
           and impact of the breach, ensuring a balanced, fair and effective approach to scheme
           participants’ non-adherence. The measures outlined in the paragraphs [PAR.33] – [PAR.47] are
           neither cumulative nor sequential. Any timeframes for the measures are indicative and
           dependent on the application of the principle of proportionality.

PAR.33          Upon verification of non-adherence by the governing authority, the governing authority will issue
                an initial notice of non-adherence to the scheme participant. The adherence notice will be
                addressed to the management body of the scheme participant.

PAR.34          The written non-adherence notice from the governing authority will:
            1. Specify the exact rulebook terms or provisions that are not met.


            2. Assign a severity level (high, medium, low) 9 to the non-adherence, based on the type of
                  rulebook requirement that was breached, the materiality of the breach, the existence of
                  persistent or cumulative cases of non-adherence.


            3. Set a deadline (30 days) for the scheme participant to submit a remediation plan in writing, the
                  timeframe of which may be adjusted based on the level of severity of the non-adherence.


            4. Provide a deadline for full rectification of adherence (60 days), which may be adjusted based
                  on the level of severity of the non-adherence.


            5. Require reporting back to the governing authority upon rectification of the remediation
                  measures put in place by the scheme participant.


            6. Inform the scheme participant about their right to object the notice if they believe it is incorrect.
                  The scheme participant needs to provide adequate reasons for their objection to the governing
                  authority in writing (20 days). The governing authority will then assess the objection and in the
                  case that it is rejected, provide a written statement with a justification to the scheme participant.
                  In this case, the governing authority will also inform the scheme participant of the points (3)-
                  (5).


PAR.35          A scheme participant must submit a remediation plan to the governing authority in writing within
                the deadline specified in the adherence notice. The plan should detail corrective actions,
                timelines for their adoption, and anticipated outcomes, demonstrating the scheme participant's
                commitment to resolving the non-adherence.




9
    The severity levels will be further defined in later versions of the Rulebook, including what type of breaches of the rulebook requirements would fall
    under each severity level.

PAR.36     Alternatively, in cases of low severity, a scheme participant may respond to the initial notice of
           non-adherence with a request for a temporary exemption based on unique or extenuating
           circumstances. This shall be in line with the exemption requirements outlined in section 2.6.

PAR.37     In cases of high severity, the scheme participant may be required to take immediate action to
           resolve the non-adherence, rather than providing a remediation plan.

PAR.38     If a scheme participant fails to meet the deadlines set in the initial adherence notice or the
           submitted remediation plan, the governing authority will issue second non-adherence notice.
           The governing authority may extend the remediation deadline, contingent on:

           •     The severity and complexity of the non-adherence.


           •     Objective reasons provided by the scheme participant for missing the initial deadline.


PAR.39     If the remediation plan is not considered adequate by the governing authority, another written
           notice with a request to amend the plan may be notified to the scheme participant.
2.4.1    Penalty mechanism


PAR.40     Failure to act in line with the adherence notice within the imposed deadlines or in line with the
           remediation plan may result in further actions being taken by the governing authority against
           the scheme participant in the form of pecuniary fines or contractual penalties. The governing
           authority will issue a notice to the scheme participant of the impending probability of a fine or
           penalty. The scheme participant has the possibility to react to the notice, in writing, notifying of
           the scheme participant’s planned or existing remediation measures or with a request for further
           time in order to address the non-adherence.

PAR.41     In cases of continued non-adherence, the governing authority may impose effective,
           proportionate and dissuasive penalties or fines, taking into account the scheme participant’s
           size, activity and non-adherence’s impact.

PAR.42     Continued non-adherence may result in further increases in penalties or fines, emphasising the
           need for resolution. Depending on the timelines (see Table 2-2), failure to meet deadlines may
           result in additional fines, which may continue monthly/bi-weekly up until a maximum fine is
           imposed.

            Monthly/bi-weekly)


                    Table 2-2 – Proposed penalty and timeline per severity level

PAR.43       In cases of low severity non-adherence, in order to apply the principle of proportionality, the
             governing authority may provide guidance rather than impose fines, focusing on corrective
             actions.
2.4.2      Suspension


PAR.44       The governing authority may suspend the scheme participant's involvement in the digital euro
             scheme, for some or all services and for a defined period (maximum 6 months). The governing
             authority must notify the management body of the scheme participant in writing, indicating the
             grounds and the time period of the suspension. In these cases, the scheme participant must
             support the process, by facilitating a smooth transition of services for digital euro users,
             supporting portability and minimising disruption.
2.4.3      Termination


PAR.45       The governing authority may terminate a scheme participant's participation in the digital euro
             scheme in severe cases and due to continued non-adherence. In this case, upon notification by
             the governing authority of the termination, the scheme participant will also have the opportunity
             to contest the termination, prior to it taking effect, providing adequate grounds to the governing
             authority in case of objection.

PAR.46       In clearly and narrowly defined exceptional circumstances, immediate exclusion of a scheme
             participant from the digital euro scheme by the governing authority may be possible. A scheme

            participant may be withdrawn from the digital euro scheme in specific cases such as high
            severity of the non-adherence with the digital euro scheme rulebook requirements, where there
            are immediate risks for users and the scheme or other cases such as opening of insolvency
            proceedings or withdrawal of a credit institution license. In these cases, the decision for the
            termination of a scheme participant`s participation from the digital euro scheme would lie with
            the governing authority, and will take into account, amongst others, the remaining operational
            capabilities of the scheme participant.

PAR.47      Upon the termination of a scheme participant’s participation in the scheme, the governing
            authority must publicly communicate its termination, having already ensured prior to facilitate a
            smooth transition of services for digital euro users. This transparency ensures that all
            stakeholders are informed and can take necessary actions to protect their interests.
2.5     Exemptions

2.6     Withdrawal of voluntary participation


PAR.48      A scheme participant that is not subject to the obligation of mandatory provision of the digital
            euro services under the draft regulation [1] may voluntarily withdraw its participation from the
            digital euro scheme. Where a scheme participant decides to withdraw from the scheme, a
            scheme participant must give written notice in due time (6 months in advance of withdrawal) to
            the scheme governing authority. The scheme participant would need to inform its digital euro
            users of the withdrawal and about the process of digital euro account switching.

PAR.49      In all cases where a scheme participant withdraws its participation, they must ensure continued
            access for users to the digital euro scheme until the end of the scheme participant’s
            participation.

PAR.50      The scheme participant needs to ensure adherence with all rulebook requirements and remains
            responsible until the end of participation.

PAR.51      The scheme participant shall support potential dispute cases, ensure data storage and
            availability as well as fee settlement beyond the termination of its participation in the digital euro
            scheme.

PAR.52      The scheme participant shall facilitate, in advance of the technical offboarding from the DESP,
            the switching of digital euro accounts of digital euro users to other scheme participants.

            the day of which the withdrawal enters into effect by the governing authority.



3     Functional requirements

3.1     Section overview

This section defines the functional and operational model of the different services in scope of the digital
euro scheme. The functional and operational model is supported by end-to-end (E2E) process flows.
Summarised process flows are included in this section while detailed process flows are included in Annex
B2 – E2E flows. The process flows were designed on the basis of illustrative user journeys, available in
Annex B1– Illustrative user journeys.

3.2     Illustrative user journeys

User journeys illustrate how the various functions and features of the digital euro are utilised from a digital
euro user perspective and provide an overview of specific user-related processes.

FUR.01      The user journeys are illustrative of the intended outcomes and are not directly binding for
            scheme participants.


FUR.02      Scheme participants may offer additional use cases not included in the illustrative user journeys


The illustrative user journeys are included in Annex B1 Illustrative user journeys. This annex reflects the
progress at a specific point in time, so the number of use cases and user journeys may evolve over time.

3.3     Identification of digital euro users

3.3.1    Digital Euro Account Number

FUR.03      When requesting a Digital Euro Account Number (DEAN) from the Digital Euro Service Platform
            (DESP) to create a new digital euro account, scheme participants shall provide a
            pseudonymised digital euro user unique identifier mirroring the attributes of Personal
            Identification (PID) foreseen by the eIDAS2 Regulation.


FUR.04      A DEAN is requested by a scheme participant from the DESP. The DESP generates the DEAN
            and then provides it to the requesting PSP. The PSP then assigns the DEAN to the digital euro
            user that wishes to open digital euro services.

                                                                                                        ECB-PUBLIC




FUR.05      The DEAN is independent of the requiring PSP and does not rely on country identification.


FUR.06      Even though, the DEAN is PSP and country agnostic, scheme participants can request PSP
            and country identification to DESP: a mapping table linking each DEAN with its PSP identifier
            will be requestable by the scheme participant. This table will make it possible to identify the
            scheme participants responsible for an account and the country associated to this scheme
            participant.


FUR.07      Digital Euro Account Numbers (DEANs) are composed of 18 alphanumerical characters and
            respect a specific structure:


    1. The first two characters are the Latin alphabetic characters ‘E’ and ‘U’.

    2. The third and fourth characters are two check digits generated using the ISO/IEC 7064, MOD 97-
         10 algorithm.

    3. The fifth character is an indicator digit that provides specific information about the DEAN.

    4. The sixth to eighteenth characters form a 13-digit serial number.

    5. The fifth to eighteenth characters (including the indicator digit and the serial number) are known as
         the Basic European Account Number (BEAN).

3.3.2    Alias

The DEAN is the basic identifier requested in the digital euro legal act, yet it can be accompanied by
alternative identification means – an alias. The alias could be used in the same way as the DEAN for
identifying the user in the payment process as long as the alias is registered.

FUR.08      The provision of an alias by the user is voluntary.


FUR.09      Scheme participants shall support the alias registration.


FUR.10      Consumers can use an alias, mapped to the corresponding DEAN, for identifying themselves
            and using digital euro services.


FUR.11      An alias shall only be a phone number that is linked to the digital euro individual user.


FUR.12      There is only a one-to-one relationship between the alias (phone number) and DEAN.

FUR.13      Scheme participants shall perform an alias verification when registering alias (e.g. sending a
            one-time password to the phone number provided by the user and the user needs to enter it in
            the app or the internet banking application).


FUR.14      In case an individual user’s mobile number changes, then the user should be able within the set
            of access management features offered by his/her PSP to request the change of alias. His/her
            PSP should then take the request further to the DESP component – following the alias
            verification as outlined above. It is also recommended that PSPs put in place a periodic (e.g.
            annual) reconfirmation requirement to ensure that their customers’ alias is still up to date.


FUR.15      Business users are not able to use an alias as an identification method.


FUR.16      When using a physical card as a form factor, the DEAN shall be printed on the card to identify
            users


3.3.3    Identification and authentication of components

FUR.17      Only those components provided by a scheme participant or any other third party registered
            within the scheme shall be authorised to operate within the digital euro transaction flows.


Digital euro components refer to the various technological and infrastructural elements that collectively
enable digital euro transactions between parties. The components include ATMs, physical POS or virtual
POI, merchant devices, APIs, applications or chipcards. To ensure the security, integrity and efficiency in
this ecosystem, the identification and authentication of these different components are essential.

The interactions, communication, and identification protocols for these components will be elaborated in
the rulebook section dedicated to their respective use cases.

Every specific interaction point will be detailed once the respective specification work concludes e.g. the
card to terminal specifications will likely be driven by the standard selected for the respective transaction
lag. The standard will define in which way the card/phone identifies itself towards the terminal. The same
will need to be defined also for all the different other use cases.

3.4     Authentication of digital euro users

3.4.1    Users onboarded on the digital euro app

FUR.18      Scheme participants shall implement and make available seamless authentication for online
            digital euro transactions and online access to digital euro accounts, as further specified in annex

            D1. Front-end implementation specifications Seamless authentication relies on public key
            cryptography and the use of biometrics (or alternatively a PIN) to allow the authentication to
            take place within the digital euro app in which the user action is initiated without any redirection
            to another app.


FUR.19      Scheme participants shall enroll users into the seamless authentication solution when the user
            onboards on the digital euro app. It is expected that seamless authentication will be the default
            way to authenticate users that are onboarded on the digital euro app, with redirection offered
            as a fallback solution if seamless authentication is temporarily unavailable.


FUR.20      For e-commerce transactions, decoupled authentication using biometrics or a PIN via a
            notification in the user’s digital euro or PSP app is the primary authentication method.


3.4.2    Users relying on PSPs’ digital interfaces

FUR.21      Scheme participants are free to implement their preferred strong customer authentication
            method when users rely on their digital interfaces. The authentication method shall comply with
            all applicable regulatory frameworks and associated security requirements.


FUR.22      Scheme participants must abide by the minimum user experience standards set in section 8.


3.4.3    Authentication for offline digital euro

FUR.23      Authentication for offline payment transactions (P2P, POS) relies on the device's local
            authentication mechanisms for both the digital euro app and PSP app. For offline digital euro
            operations that require internet connectivity, such as (de)funding and device deactivation, the
            same authentication approach used for online digital euro transactions is applied (refer to
            sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2).


3.4.4    Authentication with no smartphone (inclusion use cases)

FUR.24      Without prejudice to the accessibility requirements of the European Accessibility Act and as per
            the requirements of the future Payment Services Regulation, scheme participants shall ensure
            that all their customers, including persons with disabilities, older persons, persons with low
            digital skills and persons who do not have access to digital channels or payment instruments,
            have at their disposal at least a means of authentication adapted to their specific situation..

3.4.5     Authentication in “open PSP”

FUR.25       The distributing PSP shall enable one single authentication of the user in situations where the
             user is using a different PSP for the funding of the digital euro account – a situation referred to
             as “open PSP situation”.


3.5       Digital euro services - steps and requirements

This section describes the digital euro focus areas of most relevance to digital euro users.

      •   Access management – registration and management of digital euro users: describes the
          processes for onboarding, offboarding, lifecycle management and switching for digital euro users
          (see section 3.5.2).

      •   Liquidity management – distribution of a digital euro: details funding/defunding of the user’s
          digital euro account from and to a non-digital euro payment account to be available 24 hours a day
          during all calendar days of the year and describes the digital euro user’s holding limit.
          Funding/defunding shall be possible both manually or automatically at a pre-defined moment in
          time or at the breach of a threshold, other than the holding limit, defined by the user (including
          reverse waterfall and waterfall triggered at the breach of the holding limit). Funding/defunding shall
          also be possible from and to cash manually via ATM or scheme participant’s branch according to
          its respective service hours if provided by the scheme participant as part of its non-digital euro
          payment services (see section 3.5.3).

      •   Transaction management – processing of digital euro transactions: describes the services
          that enable users to make transactions in digital euro (through a one-off or recurring payment,
          standing order and a pre-authorisation service). It comprises activities including authentication,
          transaction initiation and payment confirmation/rejection, as well as refund processes (see
          section 3.5.4).

Figure 3-1 shows an overview of the described focus areas listing digital euro user services.

3.5.1     Functional requirements specific naming conventions
This section describes the naming conventions used.

The descriptions are based on the concepts of process and process-step:

          •    A process refers to an end-to-end completion of the major business functions/a major business
               function carried out by [one of] the different parties involved.
          •    A process-step is defined as the realisation of each step of one process executed by the
               parties involved in that step.

3.5.2     Access management

3.5.2.1       Onboarding

FUR.26         Scheme participants are responsible for the onboarding of digital euro users.


FUR.27         Scheme participants shall comply with the applicable business rules and end-to-end process
               flows for the onboarding of a user as defined in this subsection.


High-level overview

Onboarding can take place online within a scheme participant’s remote environment, or through the digital
euro app offered by the Eurosystem, or in person during the scheme participant’s service hours, if such

onsite services are provided by the scheme participant as part of its non-digital euro payment services 10.
Onboarding consists of activities that provide a digital euro user access and ability to use the digital euro
online and offline, including the allocation of Digital Euro Account Number(s) (DEAN(s)) and the user’s
payment instrument(s) or acceptance solution(s).

Individual digital euro users can ask for a (voluntary) registration of an alias to receive online payments, in
addition to being addressable via a DEAN.

A high level flow for the onboarding of a user is shown in Figure 3-2.




                            Figure 3-2 High level flow for the onboarding of a digital euro user

Description of steps:

        1. The user requests its PSP to provide access to digital euro services

        2. The PSP onboards (only if unknown) and/or authenticates the user according to its processes and
              applicable regulations

        3. The PSP requests the DESP to generate a DEAN mapped to the PSP

        4. The DESP generates a DEAN and maps it to the PSP

        5. The DESP returns the generated DEAN and confirms to the PSP the updated mapping

        6. The PSP receives and links the DEAN to the digital euro user, activates the user’s payment
              instrument(s) or acceptance solution(s) and sets up liquidity management and notification
              preferences (if requested by the user)

        7. The PSP informs the user about successful onboarding and shares the DEAN associated with the
              digital euro account.

A detailed description of the end-to-end flows is included in Annex B2.

     Offering these two options is crucial to promote financial inclusion. Indeed, a full remote onboarding could strengthen the accessibility of the digital
      euro to people facing geographical and social barriers while an onboarding with live human interaction could benefit those people less confident
      with digitalisation including the elderly.

FUR.28     Scheme participants are responsible for the switching function enabling individual users to
           seamlessly transfer digital euro holdings as well as all or some digital euro payment services
           across PSPs, while maintaining the same DEAN.

FUR.29     Scheme participants shall ensure a seamless transition of digital euro accounts when requested
           by users. They shall provide clear guidance and support, including comprehensive instructions
           for initiating the switch. Additionally, they shall offer multiple channels for users to initiate the
           switching service, such as online platforms, mobile applications, and in-person customer service.


FUR.30     Upon receiving a switching request, the new PSP shall gather the necessary data and conduct
           due diligence procedure to verify the user's identity and account status. These verification
           procedures should align with the new PSP's existing regulatory processes to ensure compliance
           with all relevant regulations.


FUR.31     Individual users shall not be charged fees for switching including transferring transaction history,
           and/or standing orders and recurring payments, and a remediation period of at least 90 days
           shall be granted to resolve any issues arising from the switch.


FUR.32     Scheme participants shall comply with the business rules and end-to-end process flows for the
           switching of digital euro users as defined in this subsection.


Emergency account switching


As outlined in the draft legislation [1], in cases of prolonged service disruption or data loss by a PSP, the
Eurosystem may declare an emergency situation along the rules set by the legal framework, allowing users
to switch their accounts to a new PSP without requiring support from the previous PSP. This ensures that
individual users maintain access to their online digital euro holdings.


FUR.33     Scheme participants shall have internal procedures and processes in place to facilitate
           emergency switching, utilising the technical proof provided by users. The technical proof is
           generated during onboarding (see section 3.5.2.1).


FUR.34     In the event of an emergency situation activated by the Eurosystem, scheme participants acting
           as new PSPs, after conducting due diligence and verification procedures similar to those for
           standard account switching, shall be able to grant individual users access to their digital euro
           holdings using the technical proof. In such cases, data from the previous PSP, such as
           transaction history, cannot be recovered. Therefore, the new PSPs should clearly communicate
           this limitation to the user, confirm the completion of the process, and provide any necessary
           follow-up information.

High-level switching overview

Scheme participants shall enable digital euro users to switch their digital euro payment accounts to another
scheme participant upon request while maintaining the same account identifiers. After the new PSP accepts
a switching request from an individual user (e.g. after conducting due diligence procedure), it initiates all
required procedures and processes to provide access to digital euro online holdings and can, upon
individual user consent, obtain additional individual user’s data from the previous PSP (e.g., transaction
history, recurring payments and standing orders). The individual user also receives an updated PSP
identifier and technical proof that is needed for emergency situations in which the current account-providing
scheme participant were to be unable to support digital euro services for a prolonged time.

In emergency situations, the emergency switching function will ensure an individual user’s undisputed
accessibility to her digital euro holdings. Such a procedure will allow digital euro users to switch to another
scheme participant even without the support of the previous participant. Therefore, in case of a failure of
the scheme participant and complete loss of its data used to access and manage digital euro holdings, a
user will be provided with an emergency switching to another scheme participant. Upon the Eurosystem’s
declaration of an emergency case for a specific PSP, the new PSP will be able to access the user’s digital
euro holdings via the technical proof the individual user received during onboarding to the digital euro (or
during successful switching cases thereafter). The main difference to the standard switching scenario is
that the individual user’s data from the previous PSP (e.g. transaction history) cannot be restored from
previos PSP’s data in the emergency case.

Account switching does not cover the switching of individual user’s offline digital euro holdings. Since they
are locally stored on the offline device, prior to deactivating the offline device for the switching any offline
digital euro holdings can be defunded to either online digital euro holdings, private money or cash, or be
transferred to another offline device.

A detailed description of the related end-to-end flows is included in Annex B2.

Technical aspects related to the transfer of recurring payments and standing orders from one scheme
participant to another are still under investigations and will be developed in the next iteration of this section.

 AM-031-001     An individual user may request the switching (while maintaining the same DEAN)
                across PSPs at any time. Such a request can only be refused by the current (previous)
                PSP for the following reasons:
                     • some or all of the user’s digital euro holdings are reserved by pre-
                          authorisation(s) (see section 3.5.4.5);
                     • there is a (pre-)dispute(s) related to a transaction(s) from or to the account that
                          has (have) not been resolved yet;
                     • the user’s digital euro account is blocked by the PSP for e.g. compliance or
                          fraud reasons.
 AM-031-002     Both the previous and the new PSP must enable the individual user to transfer the
                user’s transaction history of (at least) 13 months in the past and/or the user’s recurring
                payments and standing orders when switching.
 AM-031-003     If the individual user chooses to switch without transferring the transaction history, the
                previous PSP must allow the user to retrieve the transaction history for (at least) 13
                months after the switching.
 AM-031-004     If the individual user chooses to move the transaction history and/or the recurring
                payments and standing orders, the previous PSP sends to the new PSP:
                     • the transaction history that the new PSP must make available to the user,
                          and/or
                     • the recurring payment and standing order parameters that the new PSP must
                          use, in accordance with section 3.5.4.4, after obtaining one single explicit
                          consent to seamlessly continue all such arrangements without requiring the
                          user to re-authorise each one individually.
 AM-031-005     The previous and new PSP must authenticate the individual user and obtain approval
                for the switching request, including for moving the transaction history and/or the
                recurring payments and standing orders, before executing it.
                The previous and new PSP shall require a single, comprehensive consent from the
                user for the switching, rather than separate consent for each operation.
 AM-031-006     After accepting the switching request, the previous PSP must refrain from processing
                any further payment, funding or defunding requests involving the digital euro account
                that is to be switched.
 AM-031-008     After accepting the switching request, the new PSP is responsible for initiating all
                necessary procedures and processes to grant the user access to their online digital
                euro holdings.
 AM-031-009     The new PSP shall confirm the switching and must share the new technical proof with
                the individual user when switching is completed successfully.
 AM-031-007     Offline digital euro device and holdings cannot be automatically transferred from

 Business rules - Managing digital euro account(s)

 Individual user business rules:

 AM-021-001     The PSP must give individual users the possibility to block and unblock their digital

3.5.2.4    Offboarding

FUR.37       As scheme participants, PSPs are responsible for the offboarding of digital euro users.


FUR.38       Scheme participants shall comply with the business rules and end-to-end process flows for the
             offboarding of a digital euro user as defined in this subsection.


High-level offboarding overview


The offboarding is a procedure initiated when a digital euro user chooses to close their digital euro account.
The PSP shall be able to return the funds associated with a DEAN or an offline digital euro device to the
offboarding user (online and offline defunding), deactivate recurring payments and standing orders (if
activated), resolve pending disputes, close all open transactions and disable access to payment
instruments or acceptance solutions.

A high level flow for the offboarding of a user is shown in Figure 3-3.




                  Figure 3-3 - High level flow for the offboarding of a digital euro user

Description of steps:

    1. The user requests the PSP to be offboarded from digital euro services

    2. The PSP authenticates the user, locks the digital euro account and payment instrument(s) or
          acceptance solution(s)

    3. If the user’s digital euro account has a positive balance (online and/or offline), the PSP sends a
          defunding instruction to DESP to defund the digital euro holdings (for online the defunding is
          triggered by the PSP, while for offline defunding is triggered by the user)

    4. The DESP validates and defunds the user’s digital euro account

    5. The DESP confirms the defunding to the PSP

    6. The PSP credits the non-digital euro payment account or provides cash (according to the user’s
        preferences)

    7. The PSP requests the DESP to close the user’s digital euro account and deactivate user
        registration

    8. The DESP deactivates the user registration and closes the user’s digital euro account

    9. The DESP confirms the deactivation of user registration and closing of the user’s digital euro
        account to the PSP

    10. The PSP disables digital euro services and payment instrument(s) or acceptance solution(s) for
        the offboarded user

    11. The PSP informs the user about successful offboarding

Applicable business rules and end-to-end flows

 Business rules

 General business rules:

 AM-040-001       Users can request their PSPs to be offboarded from digital euro services at any point
                  in time. A PSP can only reject such a request for any of the following reasons:
                           • some or all of the user’s digital euro holdings are reserved by pre-
                              authorisation(s) (see section 3.5.4.5);
                           • there is a (pre-)dispute(s) related to a transaction(s) from or to the account
                              that has (have) not been resolved yet;
                           • the user’s digital euro account(s) is (are) blocked by the PSP for e.g.
                              compliance or fraud reasons.
 Individual user business rules:

 AM-041-001     The PSP accepting the offboarding of an individual user must ensure that the user can
                neither receive nor send any further digital euro payments and that the individual user’s
                online and/or offline digital euro holdings are defunded and offline device deactivated
                prior to the completion of the offboarding.
 Business user business rules:

 AM-042-001        The PSP accepting the offboarding of a business user must ensure that the user can
                   neither receive nor send any further digital euro payments and that the offline device(s)
                   is (are) deactivated prior to the completion of the offboarding.

3.5.3   Liquidity management

Scheme participants shall support liquidity management of digital euro users within the digital euro holding
limit (see section 3.5.3.5), supporting the full range of methods for users to fund (see section 3.5.3.1) and/or
defund (see section 3.5.3.2) their digital euro holdings.

To maximise payment convenience, an individual user may choose to link an online digital euro account to
a non-digital euro payment account to pay with digital euro even though available digital euro holdings do
not suffice (see section 3.5.3.3) or receive a digital euro payment that would exceed the holding limit and
defund the amount in excess (see section 3.5.3.4). In these cases, the user has the option to set up reverse
waterfall and waterfall functionalities, which requires linking an existing non-digital euro payment account
with the online digital euro account.

Neither a non-digital euro payment account nor a link between such an account and an online digital euro
account are prerequisites for individual users to receive access to digital euro services. A business user
shall always link the digital euro account(s) to a non-digital euro payment account enabling (at least) the
waterfall function necessary to enforce the busines user`s holding limit.

A high level flow for a funding and defunding operation is shown in Figure 3-4.

3.5.3.1         Funding

FUR.39            Scheme participants shall support the full range of funding functionalities for users to fund their
                  digital euro holdings.


FUR.40            Scheme participants shall comply with the applicable business rules and end-to-end process
                  flows for funding as defined in this subsection.


High-level overview

The funding functionalities allow digital euro users to fund their digital euro holdings online and offline.
Funding can be done from a non-digital euro payment account held at the scheme participant of the user’s
choice or from cash. Funding functionalities from non-digital euro payment accounts shall be available 24
hours a day and on all calendar days of the year. Funding from cash via ATM or PSP’s branch(es) of




11
     A (de)funding operation might involve a different PSP in case the PSP providing the digital euro account and the PSP providing the non-digital euro
      payment account are not the same.

scheme participants shall be supported according to their respective service hours if provided by a scheme
participant as part of its non-digital euro payment services.

Scheme participants may offer manual and automated funding functionalities as per the following
combinations:

Online digital euro funding

     •     Online manual funding from a non-digital euro payment account or cash;

     •     Online automated funding from a non-digital euro payment account.

Offline digital euro funding

     •     Offline manual funding from a non-digital euro payment account or cash;

     •     Offline manual funding from online digital euro holdings;

     •     Offline automated funding from a non-digital euro payment account or online digital euro holdings.

Manual funding from a non-digital euro payment account can be triggered by the user from any payment
account held by the user at either the same scheme participant which services the user’s digital euro
account or at another PSP that is a scheme participant. Manual funding from cash requires an existing
relationship with the scheme participant if provided by the participant as part of its non-digital euro payment
services. In the case of funding by cash, users would either access an ATM or go to a branch of their PSP
and hand the cash to an employee (or be assisted in the use of the ATM).

Automated funding functionalities can be activated at the individual user’s choice from a non-digital euro
payment account (e.g. the linked payment account). 12 Additionally, in case of offline, automated funding
functionalities can be activated from the online digital euro holdings. An individual user has the options to
schedule regularly recurring funding operations with a set amount and frequency and/or to set a minimum
threshold (within the holding limit), which is automatically maintained by funding the missing amount if the
set threshold is breached after an outgoing transaction. 13

A detailed description of the related end-to-end flows is included in Annex B2.



Applicable business rules and end-to-end flows

 Business rules

 General business rules:

 LM-020-001       The PSP shall ensure that the manual and automated funding functionalities from a
                  non-digital euro payment account are available to digital euro users on 24 hours a day
                  and on all calendar days of the year.
                  The non-digital euro payment account can be any payment account held by the user
                  at either the same PSP which services the user’s digital euro account or at another
                  PSP that is a scheme participant.
 LM-020-002       The PSP must ensure that the manual funding functionalities from cash are available
                  to digital euro users who have an existing relationship with the PSP, with these
                  functionalities accessible trough ATM and/or PSP’s branch according to their
                  respective service hours if provided by the PSP.
 Individual user business rules:

 LM-021-001     The PSP must offer individual users the possibility to fund its offline digital euro device
                from online digital holdings. This requires the PSP to request defunding first (see
                section 3.5.3.2), followed by a funding request (see section 3.5.3.1).
 LM-021-002     The PSP must allow individual users to set up, change and terminate automated
                funding. The user must be allowed to specify:
                     • the start date, funding frequency, and funding amount, and/or
                     • the minimum threshold (within the holding limit), which is to be automatically
                         maintained by the PSP by funding the missing amount if the set minimum
                         threshold is breached after an outgoing transaction.
 LM-021-004     If the individual user has set up automated funding and the funding amount is not
                available on either the non-digital euro payment account (for online and offline funding)
                or the online digital euro holdings (for offline funding only), the funding process must
                be aborted and the PSP must inform the user.
 LM-021-005     The PSP must allow individual users to specify that the automated funding can only be
                applied if the non-digital euro payment account holds sufficient balance, only within the
                financial agreement specified between the user and the PSP providing the non-digital
                euro payment account.
 LM-021-006     If the individual user has linked a non-digital euro payment account to the digital euro
                account, this linked payment account should be presented by the PSP as the default
                source account for manual and/or automated funding. However, the user should be
                offered the possibility to specify another non-digital euro payment account instead of
                the linked payment account.
 LM-021-007     After having made any debit to the individual user’s digital euro account (see section
                3.5.4), the PSP must check if the available balance on the online digital euro account
                has dropped below the minimum threshold specified by the individual user for
                automated funding (if applicable). If it has, the PSP must initiate the funding of the
                account as per the individual user’s liquidity management settings.

3.5.3.2    Defunding

FUR.41       Scheme participants shall support the full range of methods for user’s to defund their digital euro
             holdings.


FUR.42       Scheme participants shall comply with the applicable business rules and end-to-end process
             flows for defunding as defined in this subsection.


High-level overview


The defunding functionalities allow digital euro users to defund their digital euro holdings online and offline.
Defunding can be done to a non-digital euro payment account at the scheme articipant of the user’s choice
or to cash. Defunding functionalities to a non-digital euro payment account shall be available 24 hours a
day and on all calendar days of the year. Defunding to cash at ATM or PSP branch can be used according
to the respective service hours if provided by the scheme participant.

PSPs may offer manual and automated defunding functionalities as per the following combinations:

Online digital euro defunding

    •     Online manual defunding to a non-digital euro payment account or cash;

       •   Online automated defunding to a non-digital euro payment account.

Offline digital euro defunding

       •   Offline manual defunding to a non-digital euro payment account or cash;

       •   Offline manual defunding to online digital euro holdings;

       •   Offline automated defunding to a non-digital euro payment account or the online digital euro
           holdings.

Manual defunding to a non-digital euro payment account can be triggered by the user to any payment
account held by the user at either the same PSP which services the user's digital euro account or at another
PSP that is a scheme participant. In the case of defunding to cash, users would either access an ATM and
withdraw banknotes or receive cash from an employee at a branch of their PSP if provided by the PSP as
part of its non-digital euro payment services (or be assisted in the use of the ATM).

Automated defunding functionalities can be activated at the individual user’s choice to a non-digital euro
payment account (e.g. the linked payment account). 14 Aditionally, in case of offline, automated defunding
functionalities can be activated to the digital euro holdings. An individual user has the option to schedule
regularly recurring defunding operations with an amount and a defunding frequency, and/or to set a
maximum treshold (within the holding limit), which is automatically maintained by defunding the surplus
amount if the set maximum treshold is breached after an incoming transaction. 15

A detailed description of the related end-to-end flows is included in Annex B2.


Applicable business rules and end-to-end flows

     Business rules

     General business rules:

     LM-040-001           The PSP must ensure that manual and automated defunding functionalities to a non-
                          digital euro payment account are available to digital euro users on 24 hours a day and
                          on all calendar days of the year.
                          The non-digital euro payment account can be any payment account held by the user
                          at either the same PSP which services the user's digital euro account or at another
                          PSP that is a scheme participant.




14
   The non-digital euro payment account can be any payment account held by the user either at the same PSP which services the user's digital euro
    account or at another PSP that is a scheme participant.
15
   The check of whether automated defunding needs to be initiated is performed either by the PSP for online automated defunding or by the app for
    offline automated defunding whenever the offline device comes online.

 LM-040-002       The PSP must ensure that the manual defunding functionalities to cash are available
                  to digital euro users via ATM and/or PSP’s branch, according to their respective service
                  hours if provided by the PSP.
                  Manual defunding to cash via ATM does not require an existing relationship between
                  the end user and the PSP operating the ATM.
 LM-040-003       The PSP must credit the user's non-digital euro payment account immediately after
                  receiving the confirmation from DESP that the defunding instruction has been settled.
 Individual user business rules:

 LM-041-001     The PSP must offer individual users the possibility to defund its offline digital euro
                device to online digital euro holdings. This requires the PSP to request defunding first
                (see section 3.5.3.2), followed by a funding request (see section 3.5.3.1).
 LM-041-002     The PSP must allow individual users to set up, change and terminate automated
                defunding. The user must be allowed to specify:
                     • the start date, defunding frequency, and defunding amount, and/or
                     • the maximum threshold (within the holding limit), which is to be automatically
                         maintained by the PSP by defunding the surplus amount if the set maximum
                         threshold is breached after an incoming transaction.
 LM-041-003     If the user has set up automated defunding and the defunding amount is not available
                on the digital euro account, the defunding process must be aborted and the PSP must
                inform the user.
 LM-041-004     If the user has linked a non-digital euro payment account to the digital euro account,
                this linked payment account shall be presented by the PSP as the default destination
                account for manual defunding. However, the user shall be offered the possibility to
                select another non-digital euro payment account instead of the linked payment
                account.
 LM-041-005     When processing an incoming transaction to the user’s digital euro account (see
                section 3.5.4), the PSP shall check if the incoming transaction would breach the
                maximum threshold specified by the user on the online digital euro account (if
                applicable). If it would breach the maximum threshold, the PSP must initiate the
                defunding as per the user’s automated defunding settings.

3.5.3.3    Reverse waterfall

FUR.43      An individual user may allow automatic transfers of money via a reverse waterfall functionality
            from the linked non-digital euro payment account if digital euro holdings are not sufficient to
            complete a digital euro payment transaction.


FUR.44      Scheme participants shall comply with the applicable business rules and end-to-end process
            flows for the reverse waterfall functionality as defined in this subsection.


High-level overview

Via a reverse waterfall functionality an individual user may allow automatic transfers of money from the
linked non-digital euro payment account if digital euro holdings are not sufficient to complete a digital euro
payment transaction. The activation of the reverse waterfall is mandatory for business users to enforce
business user’s online holding limit while ensuring an adequate user experience when paying a business
in digital euro (see section 3.5.3.5).

The reverse waterfall is solely available for online digital euro payment transactions.

In case the user does not have sufficient digital euro holdings, the reverse waterfall (if activated by the user)
will be triggered to cover for the insufficient digital euro holdings to perform the outgoing digital euro
payment transaction. The check whether reverse waterfall is required is integrated into the pre-settlement
validation of an online digital euro payment transaction (so called ‘balance pre-check’, executed by the
payer’s PSP). Likewise, the settlement of reverse waterfall is fully integrated into the settlement of an online
digital euro payment transaction.

If the reverse waterfall is not activated, or if it fails due to, e.g. insufficient funds on the linked non-digital
euro payment account (within the financial agreement specified between the user and the PSP providing

High-level overview

Via a waterfall functionality an individual user may allow automatic transfers of money to the linked non-
digital euro payment account if the online digital euro holding limit is reached. The activation of the waterfall
is mandatory for business users to enforce business users online holding limit when accepting digital euro
payment.

The waterfall functionality is solely available for online digital euro transactions.

In case an incoming digital euro payment transaction would exceed the holding limit on the user’s digital
euro account, the waterfall (if activated by the user) will be triggered for the excess amount above the
holding limit (current digital euro balance plus transaction amount minus holding limit). The check whether
waterfall is required is integrated into the pre-settlement validation of an online digital euro payment
transaction (so called ‘balance pre-check’ executed by payee’s PSP). Likewise, the settlement of waterfall
is integrated into the settlement of an online digital euro payment transaction.

If the waterfall is not activated, or if it fails, with an incoming digital euro payment transaction exceeding the
holding limit, both the digital euro payment transaction and the waterfall will not be processed.

Further details on the management of digital euro payment transactions can be found under section 3.5.4

In exceptional circumstances an additional waterfall may be necessary after settlement confirmation to
handle the following scenario (so-called post-settlement holding limit check):

    •   Incoming digital euro payment transaction 1 is received. The check is performed to verify if it would
        result in a breach of the holding limit. This is not the case. Waterfall is not triggered.

    •   Incoming digital euro payment transaction 2 is received while transaction 1 has not yet been settled.
        The check is performed to verify if it would result in a breach of the holding limit. This is not the
        case at this point in time. However, after settlement of incoming transaction 1, transaction 2 would
        breach the holding limit. Waterfall is not triggered by the standard validation. To ensure the holding
        limit, the additional waterfall step is performed after settlement. Further details can be found in the
        relevant end-to-end flows.

High-level overview

Scheme participants are responsible for the transaction management outlining the ways of digital euro
users paying and receiving payments at any time (24 hours a day and on all calendar days of the year) and
everywhere. This involves providing a variety of payment instruments and acceptance solutions, such as
cards and payment apps for individual users, and physical or virtual points of interaction for business users,
like POS or e/m-commerce systems. These instruments and solutions are supported by different
communication technologies (e.g. chip contact, NFC, QR code and possibly an alias). The digital euro can
be used in various transactions:

       •     (online and offline) P2P payment transactions (see section 3.5.4.1),

       •     (online) e-commerce payment transactions 16 (see section 3.5.4.2), and

       •     (online and offline) POS payment transactions 17 (see section 3.5.4.3).

Digital euro users will also be able to use a digital euro for recurring payments and standing orders (see
section 3.5.4.4), in full or partial refunds (see section 3.5.4.6), and in payments enabled via the pre-
authorisation service (see section 3.5.4.5).

Digital euro users will also have the right to dispute an (un-)successful digital euro payment transaction.
The dispute management principles, processes and rules are described in section 6.

Offline digital euro payment transactions occur directly between payer and payee devices, enforcing any
relevant rules locally on the device. Since PSPs are not involved in these transactions, details about offline
transactions will not be further covered in this section, except for references to the offline end-to-end flows.

Online digital euro payment transaction processing depends on the payment instruments and accaptance
solutions used and can fall into two categories with regard to the required interactions between the involved
parties (payer, payee, payer’s PSP, payee’s PSP and DESP):

    •   a digital euro payment transaction initiated by the payer and submitted to DESP by the payer’s
        PSP (payer-initiated transaction), and

    •   a digital euro payment transaction initiated by the payee and submitted to DESP by the payee’s
        PSP (payee-initiated transaction).

A high level flow of a payer-initiated online digital euro payment transaction using the example of a simplified
P2P payment is shown in Figure 3-5.

Individual users may set standing orders for automatically initiating digital euro payment transactions to
other digital euro users. Once set up, individual users can access active standing orders to either modify
or terminate them.

Business users may set up recurring payments for automatically initiating digital euro payment transactions
by specifying recurring payment parameters such as the amount and frequency. These parameters, as
defined by the business user during the setup process, shall be accepted and authorised by the individual
user. Once set up, both indivudal and business users can access and view active recurring payments.
However, only business users are permitted to modify or terminate recurring payments prior to their
expiration. Any modifications of a recurring payment made by a business user must also be accepted and
authorised by the individual user.

user to ensure that the individual user pays for consumed goods or services. Since the individual user can
only be charged the pre-authorised amount at most, 21 the service ensures a good user experience.

Like recurring e-commerce payments, amendments and terminations of pre-authorisations are performed
by the business user before it shares an update with the individual user via their PSPs.

A detailed description of the related end-to-end flows is included in Annex B2.


Applicable business rules and end-to-end flows

     Business rules

     General business rules:

     TM-050-001       Digital euro holdings reserved by a pre-authorisation can be finally settled as a whole
                      or in part, and it may also be settled for an amount exceeding the existing reservation.
                      Multiple partial settlements are possible.
                      If the final settlement amount exceeds the existing reservation, authorisation by the
                      individual user (payer) via the payer’s PSP is required for the amount that exceeds the
                      existing reservation.
     TM-050-002       If a reservation for which a reverse waterfall (see section 3.5.3.3) has been triggered
                      is finally partially settled or fails or expires, the unused digital euro holdings reserved
                      by the pre-authorisation are released and remain on the individual user's digital euro
                      account.
     TM-050-003       The amount of digital euro holdings reserved by pre-authorisation(s) on the individual
                      user’s digital euro account contributes to the calculation of the holding limit and cannot,
                      in total, exceed the holding limit.
     Individual user business rules:

     TM-051-001     The payer’s PSP must notify the individual user (payer) when holdings reserved by
                    pre-authorisation are released due to a (partial) cancellation, by settlement of the final
                    amount, or when the expiry date and time are reached.
     Business user business rules:

     TM-052-001              The payee’s PSP must notify the business user (payee) when holdings reserved by
                             pre-authorisation are released due to a (partial) cancellation, by settlement of the final
                             amount, or when the expiry date and time are reached.
     TM-052-002              A payee’s PSP must allow a business user (payee) to modify an existing reservation
                             (increase or decrease the amount, change of expiry date). A change increasing the
                             amount or extending the period of an existing reservation requires the authorisation by
                             the individual user (payer) via the payer’s PSP. A change reducing the amount or the
                             period does not require authorisation of the individual user (payer).
     TM-052-003              The payee’s PSP must allow a business user to cancel a reservation from the moment
                             of the confirmation that the digital euro holdings have been blocked throughout the
                             entire duration of the reservation.


21
      The business user may submit more than one partial settlement instruction of the pre-authorised amount, while the reservation remains active.
      These partial settlements are not considered recurring payments because they do not depend on a defined periodicity.

4.2                  Applicable standards

In order to foster a harmonized user experience of the digital euro across scheme participants as well as
to support interoperability with existing European payments infrastructure, the digital euro rulebook makes
use of existing open market standards where possible. This section introduces the list of envisaged
standards in the scope of the digital euro.


TER.01                             PSPs and potential third-party service providers shall implement the envisaged rulebook
                                   standards outlined in this section.


The standards are presented following the architecture detailed in the section 4.1, i.e., user domain
applicable standards (4.2.1), PSP domain applicable standards (4.2.2) and DESP domain applicable
standards (4.2.3). As the standard selection process is ongoing, please consider the following caveats:

4.3        Non-functional requirements and reporting
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are critical to delivering a seamless digital euro user experience
across all scheme participants. These requirements directly impact PSP’s underlying system's resilience,
efficiency and usability. The following categories of NFRs are established:

       -     Reliability: Service availability (planned or unplanned downtime) and recoverability capabilities.

       -     Performance: Transaction processing latency.

Where relevant and applicable, a future version of the rulebook will include requirement specific KPIs. In
case such KPI will be included at a later stage this is indicated by eiter ‘’ XAbc’’ or ‘’ [X]’’.

4.3.1        Reliability

TER.02           A scheme participant shall ensure a XAvailability% availability of all digital euro transaction, liquidity
                 and access management services that are not dependent on (branch) service hours 27
                 throughout the entire year on a 24-7-365 basis.


Availability is defined as the period during which digital euro services offered by scheme participants are
fully operational 28. Service availability applies continuously and throughout each day, excluding planned
maintenance and services dependent on (physical branch) service hours.


TER.03           A scheme participant shall ensure a recovery time objective (RTO) of XRTO hours for digital euro
                 payment services.


RTO is defined as the maximum tolerable amount of time required to restore one or more services to a
correct operational state after a failure or disaster event has compromised availability 29.


TER.04           A scheme participant shall ensure that planned maintenance and scheduled downtime is
                 communicated [x] days in advance, performed during off-peak hours 30, and does not exceed a
                 cumulative maximum of Xplanned mainternance hours per calendar month.




27
     Including physical onboarding or offboarding (e.g.in-person identity verification or assisted access for vulnerable users).
28
     Unavailability of services is caused by a DESP failure or outage is not considered as non-compliance. A future version of the rulebook will include a
     more detailed definition of availability.
29
     More granular incident classification and resolution time may be included in a future version of the rulebook.
30
     The definition of off-peak hours will be further detailed in a future version of the rulebook and take into account time zone differentiation.

4.3.2        Performance

TER.05           A payee PSP shall ensure that maximum processing latency for 99% of online digital euro
                 payment transactions is below XPayee PSP Latency whereby this duration is measured as the elapsed
                 time between the moment a transaction processing request is received by the payee’s PSP and
                 the moment a response is sent to the DESP, with the payee PSP conducting the following tasks
                 in the meantime:
                  •     Check client balance.
                  •     Waterfall checks - latency for the defunding of the digital euro online account shall be
                        excluded from the computation.
                  •     Sending the settlement message.

TER.06           A payer PSP shall ensure that the maximum processing latency for 99% of online digital euro
                 payment transactions is below XPayer PSP Latency + ΔE-Com,P2P whereby this duration is measured
                 as the elapsed time between the moment a payment processing request, sent by the DESP, is
                 received by the payer PSP and the moment a response is sent back to the DESP, with the payer
                 PSP conducting the following tasks in the meantime:
                  •     Check client balance and holding limit.
                  •     Waterfall checks – excluding latency for the funding of the digital euro online account
                  •     For E-Com and P2P only: receive the fraud score of the risk fraud management component
                        of the DESP 31. The latency of this task is referred to as ΔE-Com,P2P
                  •     Perform fraud checks
                  •     Sending the settlement confirmation message.

4.4       Distributing PSP technical implementation requirements

This subsection introduces the implementation specifications distributing PSPs serving individual digital
euro users should implement. The implementation specifications are further detailed in Annex D1.1 (Front-
end implementation specifications) and Annex D2 (Back-end implementation specifications). The front-end
implementation specifications are complemented with which presents the core data requirements for digital
euro services 32.

The front-end implementation specifications prescribe the requirements for individual users’ payment
instruments, user to application interfaces used in the individual user domain, and the services in the



31
     The fraud score of the risk fraud management component of the DESP must be read for e-commerce and P2P transactions. In case of POS
     transactions PSPs can optionally wait for the fraud score. Once the DESP's fraud score transmission time is established, this delta will be
     accumulated to the latency target for payer PSP processing of P2P and E-commerce transactions.
32
     The core data requirements are limited to the minimum requirements to initiate a digital euro payment transaction, the exhaustive list of all front-end
     data requirements is captured in specification #7 (Data management) of Annex D1.1 (Front-end implementation specifications).

4.5        Acquiring PSP technical implementation requirements

This subsection introduces the implementation specifications for acquiring PSPs serving digital euro
business users, government users, and other public entity users. Like for distributing PSPs the
implementaion specifications are furhter detailed in annex D1 (Front-end impemenation specifications)
annex D1.1 (Core data requirements) 51, and annex D2 (Back-end implementaion specifications)

Front-end requirments for acquiring PSPs are documented in specification #2 (Business user PSP
requirements), specification #4 (Acceptance solution requirements), and specification #5 (Common
services). The back-end implementation specifications in annex D2 prescribe how acquiring PSPs can
invoke services in the DESP domain. The specifications span across the domains depicted in Figure 4-1.

TER.10            Acquiring PSPs shall implement the specifications in annex D1.1. relevant to the digital euro
                  payment servcies they offer

A future version of the rulebook will include implementation specifications for the offline wallet SDK, offline
payment instruments, and integration with the DESP offline issuance component 52.


4.5.1         Acquiring PSP – Business user PSP requirements

The following tables lists the services per acceptance solution made accessbile by acquiring PSPs through
which digital euro payment services are executed as depicted in Figure 4-1. The tables refer to the relevant
implement specifications and chapters in annex D1.1 which are further detailed in specification #4. The
current version of the rulebook prescribes implementation specifications for e-commerce, m-commerce
transactions and a limited set of specifications for ATM services. A future version of the ruelbook will include
specifications for POS terminals. Moreover, some specifications in this overview may still have placholders.

Implemented interfaces are subject to certificaton procedures as described in annex A1 (onboarding,
certification and testing).

5     Risk management requirements

RMR.01      PSPs shall comply with all risk management requirements as detailed in annex E1.


The risk management annex is confidential and is only available on a strict need to know basis, and is not
made available as part of the rulebook.


General risk management principles may be added to this section in the future for transparency and
awareness.


6     Dispute management requirements

6.1     Section overview

This section defines the requirements of the dispute management services for a digital euro scheme. These
requirements are outlined through functional rules, dispute reasons and scenarios, and summarised
process flows. Detailed process flows are included in Annex B2: End-to-end flows, along with all other
digital euro end-to-end flows.


6.2     Dispute management overview

A dispute management process allows a digital euro payer to challenge an eligible consumer-to-business
or an eligible peer-to-peer transaction charged to their digital euro payment account.


Eligible transactions cover consumer-to-business and peer-to-peer transactions, the actors involved in the
dispute management process are: the payer, the payee, the payer’s PSP, the payee’s PSP and the DESP
operator. A payer’s PSP is a distributing PSP. A Payee’s PSP is a distributing PSP when servicing natural
person and an acquiring PSP when servicing a business user.


DMR.01      If the payer has had more than one PSP, the PSP servicing the digital euro payment account
            from which the disputed transaction was debited shall be considered as payer’s PSP.

DMR.02             If the payee has more than one PSP, the PSP servicing the digital euro payment account to
                   which the disputed transaction was credited shall be considered the payee’s PSP.


DMR.03             Each dispute management process arising in the context of the digital euro scheme shall be
                   associated with a specific digital euro transaction. The dispute management process 64 consists
                   of:


                   (1) A pre-dispute phase, allowing the payer to seek resolution with the payee with the
                   intermediation of their respective PSPs and, if no agreement is reached,


                   (2) A dispute phase, for PSPs to agree on a decision on the dispute


DMR.04             A payer disputes a digital euro transaction by providing information and supporting
                   documentation to explain the reason for the dispute. Based on the information received, the
                   payer’s PSP classifies the dispute under a specific ‘dispute reason’ and sets a ‘dispute amount’,
                   which may differ from the original transaction amount.


DMR.05             The DESP Dispute component is the infrastructure that enables the exchange of messages,
                   notifications, and supporting documentation between PSPs in the context of a dispute
                   management process.


6.2.1         Dispute eligibility requirements

DMR.06             Scheme participant shall comply with the requirements governing the eligibility of a digital euro
                   payment transaction for dispute:


     Requirements

     General requirements:

     DM-020-001              A scheme participant shall only accept dispute initiation requests submitted by the
                             digital euro payer directly.

     DM-020-002              A schemeparticipant shall ensure that every dispute management process is
                             associated with a unique digital euro payment transaction identifier.
     DM-020-003              A scheme participant shall verify that the disputed transaction falls under the category
                             of online digital euro payment transactions before proceeding with the dispute process.


64
     A possible arbitration phase, which can follow the dispute phase, is not governed by this rulebook.

6.3.2         Dispute management process

Dispute management processes consists of (a) a mandatory pre-dispute phase, and – if no agreement is
reached during the pre-dispute phase - (b) a dispute phase. A dispute management process escalates from
pre-dispute to dispute phase if neither parties have accepted the other party’s response within the
applicable timeframe.


a) Pre-dispute phase
The pre-dispute phase is a mandatory step for a digital euro payer to initiate a dispute management process
and is intended for PSPs to facilitate the exchange of information between payer and payee via a front-end
service provided by the respective PSPs. PSPs can also provide additional information, to their respective
payer and payee as well as to the counterparty PSP to facilitate the resolution of a pre-dispute before it
escalates to the dispute phase.

Description of steps:


A digital euro payer initiates a pre-dispute with its PSP via a dedicated dispute management feature in
digital euro front-end services.


       1. The payer’s PSP reviews the information and documentation received, the sends a pre-dispute
            request to the DESP – Dispute component 68


       2. The DESP - Dispute component runs a pre-dispute request validation, based on dispute eligibility
            requierments (section 6.2.1.), supporting documentation rules (section 6.2.2), dispute process
            requirements (section 6.3.1.), back-end implementation specifications (Annex D2)


       3. If the pre-dispute request is valid, the DESP – Dispute component registers a pre-dispute request
            acceptance, sends a notification of accepted pre-dispute request to the payee’s PSP (if not valid,
            the DESP – Dispute component registers a pre-dispute request rejection); the status updates to
            “Pre-dispute request accepted” (if not valid, it updates to “Pre-dispute request rejected”)


       4. The payee’s PSP receives and forwards the pre-dispute request to the payee


       5. The payee reviews and either accepts or rejectes the pre-dispute request

       6. The payee’s PSP reviews the payee’s response and sends a pre-dispute response to the DESP -
            Dispute 69 within 10 business days of receiving the pre-dispute request


       7. The DESP - Dispute component runs a pre-dispute response validation, based on supporting
            documentation requirements (section 6.2.2), dispute process requirements (section 6.3.1.), back-
            end implementation specifications (Annex D2)


       8. If valid, the DESP – Dispute component registers a pre-dispute response acceptance, and forwards
            the pre-dispute response to the payer’s PSP (if not valid, the DESP – Dispute component registers
            a pre-dispute response rejection); the status updates to “Pre-dispute response accepted” (if not
            valid, it updates to “Pre-dispute response rejected”)


       9. The payer’s PSP receives and forwards the pre-dispute request to the payer


       10. The payer reviews and either accepts or rejects the pre-dispute response


       11. The payer’s PSP forwards the payer’s decision to the DESP – Dispute component; the status
            updates to “Pre-dispute positive” or “Pre-dispute negative”)


       12. The DESP – Dispute component forwards the decision to the payee’s PSP


       13. The payee’s PSP notifies the payee.


If neither the payer nor the payee have accepted the counterparty’s decision, and if the payer wants to, the
pre-dispute escalates to the dispute phase; the status updates to “Pre-dispute closed”.


b) Dispute phase
The dispute phase is a possible subsequent phase that occurs only if the payer and the payee fail to reach
an agreement during the pre-dispute phase and is intended for the payer’s PSP and payee’s PSP to find
an agreement on the dispute. In the dispute phase, PSPs take on an active role aimed at resolving the
dispute, providing additional information and documentation if applicable.

       1. Consistently with the functional rules governing the dispute management process, the payer’s PSP
            sends a dispute request to the DESP – Dispute component 70 within 5 business days of the pre-
            dispute closing; the status updates to “Dispute requested”


       2. The DESP - Dispute component runs a dispute request validation, based on dispute eligibility

6.4     Dispute reasons

6.4.1    Reason coding conventions

Dispute reason codes identify unique dispute reasons. The code is composed of three strings, separated
by a dash.


The first three-letter string “DIS” is the same across reasons and identifies dispute management services.


The second three-letter string identifies the type of payment transaction under dispute, “TXM” for consumer-
to-business and peer-to-peer transaction dispute, and “LQM” for funding, defunding transaction disputes.


The third three-digit string numbers the reasons progressively.

 Scenarios              •   One or more digital euro payment transactions were executed without the
 covered                    payer’s authorisation or consent by a fraudulent party who gained control over
                            the payer’s digital euro account. The payer states that they retain possession
                            of their payment instruments (e.g., card, digital euro mobile app, wearables),
                            indicating that the unauthorised activity arised from an account-level breach
                            rather than the loss or theft of a payment instrument
 Conditions             •   The disputed transaction is either either consumer-to-business or peer-to-peer
 for initiating a       •  The digital euro payment transaction details show inconsistencies in the

                                    upon and registered with the PSP (e.g. hacked digital euro app
                                    session on another device, use of a hacked wearable device, use of
                                    a device not associated with the payer)
                               o The knowledge-based authentication factor (e.g., password, PIN)
                                    does not align with the recorded method or was used in an
                                    inconsistent context (e.g., password validated in a PIN-authenticated
                                    transaction)
                               o The biometric authentication factor recorded (e.g., face or fingerprint
                                    recognition) does not match the method agreed upon with the PSP or
                                    was technically implausible (e.g., face recognition validated on a 2D
                                    camera where it should not be possible)
                               o The transaction was performed using only one authentication factor,
                                    instead of the minimum SCA requirement of two distinct authentication

7     Minimum user experience requirements

Minimum user experience (UX) requirements are the set of requirements for user experience that scheme
participants must comply with when developing and offering digital euro services.

Minimum UX requirements include both generic and specific UX requirements. Generic UX requirements
are applicable to all user journeys. Specific UX requirements are organised by user journey and only apply
to that specific user journey.

Minimum UX requirements are considered mandatory for scheme participants. Optional UX requirements
are suggestions to further enhance the UX and marked as [optional]. The selection has been made based
on the principle of proportionality.

Minimum UX requirements apply to all scheme participants, and if other comparable digital means of
payment exceed these requirements, scheme participants must ensure that the digital euro UX is at least
equivalent to their respective proprietary solutions. This is known as the equivalence principle.

7.1     Generic UX requirements

8         Brand rules

8.1        Introduction

The objective of this section is to describe digital euro brand rules for scheme participants and other actors
to adhere to when implementing and using the digital euro logo and other branding elements in various
contexts.

This section has the intent to “facilitate a harmonised user experience, regardless of payment service
providers involved and the front-end services used” (digital euro legislative proposal, article 59).

These brand rules will apply to all relevant use cases and channels where the digital euro brand is used.

To accommodate for the various brand implementation scenarios that apply for payment service providers
(PSPs) and future applications, the rules are split into three parts:

      •     General brand rules – applicable across all channels and uses of digital euro brand, both physical
            and digital, to ensure consistent display and clarity,

      •     Specific brand rules - applicable to some use cases due to their specific features,

      •     Brand style guide – [PLACEHOLDER: add link to the style guide].

8.2        General brand rules

Note: For guidelines on branding placement for devices that are not included in these brand rules, refer to
the specifications included in the brand style guide. [PLACEHOLDER: add link to the style guide].

8.2.1       Logo requirements

BRR.07     Sensory branding is a form of animation and sounds, serving to provide consumers with auditory
           and visual cues, enhancing brand recognition, and providing additional audio-visual
           confirmation upon a successful transaction.


BRR.08     Animated branding is preferred whenever possible and shall be displayed with equivalent
           prominence to animations of other brands.

             sufficient contrast with the background and spacing remain applicable.


BRR.25       The use of grayscale branding shall maintain equal prominence to other brands, meaning that
             other brands need to also be displayed in grayscale. When other brands are displayed in full
             colour, digital euro branding shall also be displayed in full colour.


Downloadable branding assets and grayscale alternatives can be found in the brand style guide.
