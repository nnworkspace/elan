# Issue Templates

This folder contains **issue templates** used to structure how work enters and flows through the project.

Issue templates are **governance instruments**.  
They do not define policy, but they operationalise it by shaping how questions, requirements, decisions, and work items are expressed.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of these templates is to:

- reduce communication friction  
- ensure completeness and clarity at issue creation  
- support traceability across artefacts  
- align discussions with the project’s governance model  

Well-designed templates help diverse contributors collaborate without requiring shared assumptions or informal knowledge.

---

## Governance status

All templates in this folder are governed uniformly.

Their classification is declared at the **folder level** via `_metadata.yaml`, in accordance with the artefact classification model.

Changes to templates should therefore be treated as **governance decisions**, not casual edits.

---

## When to use templates

Issue templates should be used for:

- requirements and change requests  
- clarification questions  
- design and architectural decisions  
- implementation tasks  
- test and verification activities  

They are not intended to constrain discussion, but to **frame it productively**.

---

## Relationship to automation

Issue templates are part of the project’s automated governance:

- commits and merge requests are expected to reference issues  
- metadata captured at issue creation supports traceability  
- CI/CD pipelines may rely on issue structure for validation and reporting  

Templates therefore play a role in maintaining semantic continuity across the project lifecycle.

---

## Final note

Templates are not bureaucracy.

They are a shared language.

By shaping how work is described, they help ensure that intent is preserved as the project evolves and responsibilities change.
