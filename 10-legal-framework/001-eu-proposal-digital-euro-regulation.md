# Proposal for a Regulation on the Establishment of the Digital Euro

The **European Commission Proposal for a Regulation on the Establishment of the Digital Euro (COM/2023/369)** sets out the proposed legislative framework for introducing a digital euro across the European Union.

Key points from the proposal:

- Defines the digital euro as a new form of central bank money to exist alongside cash and coins.  
- Articles outline subject matter, definitions, and the conditions under which the digital euro may be issued.
- Once adopted, the regulation will empower the European Central Bank to decide on issuance details, including timing and volumes.
