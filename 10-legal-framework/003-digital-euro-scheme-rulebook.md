# Digital Euro Scheme Rulebook

In parallel with EU legislation, the European Central Bank is developing a **digital euro scheme rulebook**.

> A digital euro scheme rulebook will set out a single set of rules, standards, and procedures that supervised intermediaries would have to follow when distributing a digital euro.

This rulebook is intended to operationalise the legal framework once the EU Regulation is adopted.  
It will be a key artefact linking legislative requirements to implementation specifications.
