# European Parliament Analysis of Digital Euro Legal Framework

The European Parliament published analytical reports exploring how a digital euro fits within the broader EU legal framework.

One such report considers whether digital money could be introduced under the ECB’s mandate and discusses the legal tender status and monetary policy implications:

> _“This article will discuss the legal framework of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the Eurozone. The different designs proposed will be examined against the legal framework.”_

Similarly, other parliamentary analyses have noted the need for a legislative framework to define:

- legal status
- distribution model
- oversight mechanisms

These reports help contextualise the legislative proposal and provide useful background for understanding the Digital Euro’s legal contours.
