# Legal Basis and Treaties for the Digital Euro

The legal foundation for a digital euro stems from the **Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)**:

- Article 133 TFEU relates to the organisation of the EU’s monetary policy and payment systems, forming the basis for EU-wide digital currency legislation. 

Once the EU Regulation is adopted, it will provide:

- a uniform legal framework across Member States
- clarity on the legal status of the digital euro
- conditions under which it can be issued and utilised

Until that regulation is adopted, the project continues under existing treaty provisions and ECB competence, subject to legislative approval.
