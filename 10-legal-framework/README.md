# Legal Framework

This folder contains **public legislative and legal artefacts** relevant to the Digital Euro.

Its purpose is to demonstrate how **legislative intent** enters the system and becomes a first-class input to downstream rulebooks, specifications, implementations, and audits.

The contents of this folder are illustrative and educational.  
All materials referenced here are **publicly available** and reproduced or excerpted for demonstrative purposes only.


## Purpose

In large institutional projects, legislation is not background context.
It is **foundational input**.

This folder shows how legislative texts can be:

- treated as versioned artefacts  
- referenced explicitly by rulebooks and specifications  
- linked into traceability chains  
- governed alongside technical and operational deliverables  

The aim is not to interpret the law, but to **preserve legislative intent** as the system evolves.


## What belongs here

This folder may contain:

- EU regulations and legislative proposals  
- treaty provisions forming the legal basis  
- parliamentary reports and analyses  
- official communications relevant to the legal framework  

These artefacts typically serve the following traceability roles:

- `POLICY`
- `LEGAL`
- `RULE`

They are inputs to, not replacements for, scheme rulebooks and technical specifications.


## Scope and limitations

The documents in this folder:

- reflect the **public state** of the legislative process at a given point in time  
- may reference proposals, drafts, or analyses that are subject to change  
- are not a substitute for official consolidated legal texts  

In real projects, authoritative legal texts should always be sourced from official publications (e.g. EUR-Lex) and maintained accordingly.


## Relationship to other layers

The legislative framework informs, but does not dictate, downstream artefacts.

Typical relationships include:

- legislation → scheme rulebooks  
- legislation → regulatory requirements  
- legislation → architectural constraints  

These relationships should be made explicit through traceability links, not assumed implicitly.


## Governance and classification

All artefacts in this folder are expected to:

- declare classification metadata  
- be publicly accessible unless explicitly constrained  
- be treated as normative or informative according to their legal status  

Changes to legislative artefacts should reflect changes in the public legal landscape, not internal project decisions.


## Final note

Civilised systems begin with law.

By treating legislation as a first-class artefact—versioned, traceable, and governed—this project ensures that what is built remains anchored to what was intended.

This folder exists to make that anchoring explicit.
